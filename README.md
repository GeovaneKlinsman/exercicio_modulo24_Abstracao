# Vehicle Inheritance Example

This repository contains a simple example of object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript. The example demonstrates the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism by creating a base class `Veiculo` and two derived classes `Moto` and `Carro`.

## Purpose of the Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate the following OOP principles:

1. **Abstraction**: Creating a base class `Veiculo` that represents a general concept of a vehicle.
2. **Inheritance**: Creating derived classes `Moto` and `Carro` that inherit properties and methods from the base class `Veiculo`.
3. **Polymorphism**: Overriding methods in the derived classes to provide specific implementations.

## Running the Code

To run the code, use the following command:
```bash
node .\oo.js
```
This will output the information of the created vehicle instances to the console.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the basic principles of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. By creating a base class and derived classes, we can reuse code and create more specific implementations for different types of vehicles.
